# Rubymotion Loggly
> An abstraction around the loggly api 

## Goals

* bulk requests for submitting log events
* api for handling test/production environments
  * build out ability to pass keys / buckets as needed for env/test accounts ...

## Thoughts

* ability to pass in a config object
* first figure out app-config as needed

## Todo

1. Move api components to motion-loggly
2. Name this module motion logger
3. Ability to pass in a custom logger
